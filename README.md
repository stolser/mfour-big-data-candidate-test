# mfour-big-data-candidate-test
Welcome to our big data candidate test! Please complete the following exercises by forking and sending a pull request. We should be able to run your code with little setup and clearly see how you answered the questions posed in each exercise. Please try your best, answering as much as you can remembering partial code is better than no code :). If you are feeling very ambitious feel free to contribute unit tests, ideas for testing, testing strategies, other supplimental data, or even answering additional interesting bits with the data. Please enjoy and have fun with it.

## Exercise 1
Using the data in `src/main/resources/exercise1`, compare the two files to answer:

1. How many houses were sold?
1. How many crimes occurred?
1. Did any of the crimes occur at one of the houses that were sold?
1. If so:
   1. How many?
   1. What were the crimes?

After analysing the data, please output any helpful information to parquet format and read it back into the program for further analysis.

## Exercise 2
Using the data in `src/main/resources/exercise2`, compare the crimes in all of 2008 to answer:

1. Which zip codes had the most crime?
1. In those zip codes, which was the most committed crime?
1. How many times did the crimes happen over the year?
1. What months had the most crime?

After analysing the data, please output any helpful information to parquet format and read it back into the program for further analysis.
